  utter_stress_info:
  - text: It's okay to feel overwhelmed at times. Try to set realistic expectations and follow good time management techniques like working according to a work plan or a time table, divide the tasks into bite size manageable pieces, do some relaxing activities like breathing exercises, listening to music, dancing or a quick nap.
  utter_sleep_info:
  - text: Students at your age should get 7-9 hours of sleep to function to live a healthy life while balancing studies. If you are really sleeping then a quick nap might help you. It is a fact that the ideal time to study is between 4am-6am. If you can sleep early and study in the morning that is fine. But if you are night owl then the night time is the ideal time to study. Do not forget to get a good night sleep '
  utter_study_amount:
  - text: Rather than focusing on the amount of hours you study, focus on the quality of the studying. It is useless to study for an hour losing focus and covering a 5min worth amount of studying. Sometimes you get into the mood and when in that mood, push work that you planned for the next day as you dont know how you might feel by then. Basically, when you are on a roll, then keep moving. Ride the wave.
