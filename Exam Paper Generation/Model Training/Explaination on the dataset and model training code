This dataset has 3 columns.
RelatedLesson, no_of_occurrence, no_of_occurrence_future
This table represents how many questions (no_of_occurrence) student answered incorrectly in each lesson and how many
questions he will get wrong in future

For ex:
RelatedLesson, no_of_occurrence, no_of_occurrence_future
introduction to computer,1, 2
concept of it,5, 6

Student has incorrectly answered one question from 'introduction to computer' lesson and 5 questions from 'concept of it'
lesson and he will incorrectly answer 2 questions and 6 questions respectively in future exam papers if he attend any

Explanation of the code:
This code has to be run through jupyter notebook to get the graphs

# Checking if there is a correlation between no_of_occurrence and no_of_occurrence_future variables using Heatmap
 If we look across the matrix, the correlation value for no_of_occurance and no_of_occurance_future is 0.9, which indicates
 that these variables are highly correlated.

# Plot sns pair plot to visually represent the positive/negative correlation between the variables.
 So, based on the sns pair plot, the no_of_occurance is positively correlated to no_of_occurance_future.

 # Creating dummy columns for the categorical columns
 This is to divide 'Related Lessons' column into multiple columns based on the lesson name, so that it can be fed up
 to the model as a feature(Independent variable)
